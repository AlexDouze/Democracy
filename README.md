# Democracy

In a very good video from 'Le chat sceptique' https://youtu.be/NCHYDtA60-g, a statician explain how to predict if a country is a democracy or a dictatorship in regards of the high of the highest building.

Based on this idea, we use data to explore the differences between democratic and authoritarian regimes.

A study publish by the Economist on www.eiu.com, give for each country a democratic score.

The project is based on Python and on the pandas library.
