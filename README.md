# Democracy

In a very good video from 'Le chat sceptique' https://youtu.be/NCHYDtA60-g, a statician explain how to predict if a country is a democracy or a dictatorship in regards of the high of the highest building.

Based on this idea, we build models to predict if a country is a democracy or a dictatorship, in regards not-obvious parameters, like for exemple the median age of the population, and try to find the best criteria.

A study publish by the Economist on www.eiu.com, give for each country a democratic score and is used here.
